Data, such as private conversations, emails, banking account details, and credit card information will be exposed by emerging technologies. In general, sensitive information is encrypted to ensure that it remains safe, but this will change with new developments being made in quantum computing.<p>The development of quantum computers will expose the ostensibly secure internet traffic that we engage in daily; therefore, new encryption algorithms need to be researched and developed to guarantee our future privacy and security. A few remedial algorithms are being researched, but we need to quickly agree on which one will become the standard internet encryption method since the threat of a widespread internet security breach is urgent. Immediate action is needed to guarantee our future internet security.<h2 class=section>The Solution</h2><p>Among the current replacement candidates, quantum key distribution (QKD), is the biggest contender because it is scientifically sound. However, it would require new hardware to be installed to distribute the needed cryptographic keys to each computer. This requirement, in turn, ultimately defeats the purpose of the internet and its security measures.</div><div class=column><p>Another alternative, learning with error (LWE) lattice based encryption methods are faster, less expensive to implement, and geographically expansive. Implementing LWE lattice algorithms is relatively simple. Immediate actions include further researching them and then establishing a security protocol that implements them. Once the security protocol is designed, quantum computers will then make new keys which are quantum secure and that can be used on existing hardware.<p>The table below provides a summary of our proposed solution versus the biggest contender.<table><tr><td class=attribute>Type<td class=center>QKD<td class=center>LWE<tr><td class=attribute>Mechanics<td>Quantum mechanics<td>Advanced mathematics<tr><td class=attribute>Speed<td>Slow<td>Fast<tr><td class=attribute>Pros<td>Theoretically sound.<td>Not geographically limited.

To meet this goal, we have developed a method plan.<ol><li>Create an integration plan by allocating $5 million to research and explore LWE lattice based algorithms.<li>Create a prototype to implement the research using quantum computers.<li>Optimize the implementation to run efficiently.<li>Create a unified protocol for non-quantum and quantum computers.</ol><p>This plan will unify internet security and create a system that can evolve with the power of the emerging technologies.<h2 class=section>Conclusion</h2><p>Researching LWE lattices could allow us to replace our vulnerable public-key encryption methods with a secure and efficient alternative that will protect against emerging quantum computer technology. In comparison to the other contenders, LWE lattices are quantum safe, quick in calculation time, require no internet infrastructure changes upon implementation, and are ripe for further development.</div><div class=column><p>We need to reap this algorithm's benefits and protect internet users from rampant cyber attacks by beginning research now to make the necessary advancements in quantum cryptography. In the end, this must be a combined effort, or we will fail; and failure is something that we cannot afford.<h2 class=section>Sources</h2><ul class=sources><li>Broadbent, A., & Schaffner, C. (2016).
